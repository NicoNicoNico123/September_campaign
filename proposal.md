# Digital Campaign Proposal

## Campaign: Whac-A-Mole x Free Shipping Vibrator x KOL Funnel Push

**Objective:**  
Drive sales and increase email subscriptions in the Hong Kong market for the adult wellness (vibrator) category while maintaining compliance and efficiency.

---

## 1. Campaign Overview

### Context

Promoting adult wellness products faces unique regulatory and communications challenges in Hong Kong. Strategic gamification, benefit incentives (free shipping, 15% OFF code), and KOL education will combine to strengthen brand trust and conversion.

### Goals

- Increase traffic sessions by 30%
- Raise sales orders
- Raise email subscriptions
- Retain lead pool ≥ 50

---

## 2. Campaign Mechanism

### A. Gamified Activation

- **Whac-A-Mole Web Game:** Registered users can play unlimited times. The top 3 scores at the end of the month will win a free selected vibrator.
- **Participation Gift:** All players will receive a site-wide 5% OFF code (exclusive, one-time use, valid for 1 month upon issue).

### B. KOL-Driven Promotion

- **Influencers:** Jerlame, OKLA, and additional adult/relationship education KOLs on Instagram, Podcasts, and Shorts.
- **Code Mechanism:** Each KOL will receive a unique 15% OFF code (e.g., JERLAME15, OKLA15), valid across all platforms.
- **Content Cadence:** Launch with KOL posts (unboxing/education/game call-to-action), followed by weekly reminders and a last-chance push.

### C. Paid and Organic Funnel, A/B Testing

- **Paid Media:** Paid online ads focused on getting users to play the game to receive a 5% off offer on Google Search, Twitter Ads, and ExoClick as conversion drivers. No direct paid Meta due to content restrictions (native exposure only).
- **A/B Testing:**
  - Offer type (15% OFF vs. game offer)
  - Game interface/placement
- **Tracking:** Integrated CRM, UTM, KOL code tracking (with clickless attribution for podcasts/voice channels).

## 3. KOL Partnership Details

### A. Commission and Cost Model

- **Variable Rebate:** Each sale using a KOL's code receives a commission (market level 10–20%, depending on product margin and KOL influence).
- **Extra Fees:** Additional compensation may be requested by KOLs for premium placements (featured podcast segment, multiple story sets).
- **Product Send-out:** The cost to send product units for trial, unboxing, and content production is pre-agreed and included in the total campaign cost.
- **Settlement:** Monthly or campaign-end reconciliation based on code usage and data export. Escalators can be offered for high performance (e.g., 10% base, up to 20% if performance tiers are exceeded).

### B. Content and Deliverables

- **Scope:** 1 main feed or Reels post, 2 story waves or 1 podcast plug, plus a game-featured demonstration.
- **KPI Reporting:** Share code conversion, traffic, and engagement data with KOL partners for transparency and trust.

## 4. Funnel & Conversion Flow

- **Traffic Source:** KOLs, paid search/display, organic socials → Whac-A-Mole game/activation landing page.
- **Engaged User:** Completes the game → receives a unique 5% OFF code and (if a top 3 winner) free shipping on the promotion SKU.
- **Purchase Intent:** The code can be applied to any qualifying order, is not stackable with other codes, and features a visible countdown and pre-fill to minimize drop-off.
- **Remarketing:** Users who abandon their cart or have not yet used the code will receive an EDM/retargeting ad reminding them of the offer and the countdown.

---

## 5. Technical Implementation

- **Site Backend:** Set a global 15% OFF campaign rule, code white/blacklist mechanism, expiry timer (1 month, HK timezone), and a user email/cell login for access.
- **KOL Code Logic:** Mirror the same rule for different KOL code aliases for proper attribution and code leak control.
- **Game Layer:** Implement a live leaderboard with an auto-weekly reset and a direct pop-up showing discount codes.
- **Data Dashboard:** Export code usage, sales, traffic source, and KOL split for finance/settlement.

---

## 6. Compliance & Risk Management

- Follow Google/Meta policies for the adult category: no explicit images/words, 18+ disclaimer on all assets, and benefit/health/relationship-focused copy.
- Codes will only be distributed through controlled channels (KOLs, game page) to avoid leaks/abuse; limit one use per user (account/email).
- Contracts will outline KOL obligations, content delivery, KPI targets, code handling, and possible escalator/penalty clauses.
